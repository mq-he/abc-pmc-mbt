# Approximate Bayesian computation for Markovian binary trees in phylogenetics
Code for "Approximate Bayesian computation for Markovian binary trees in phylogenetics".

We implemented Approximate Bayesian Computation Population Monte Carlo (ABC-PMC) to infer the rate in Markovian Binary Trees (MBTs). We used simulation studies to test the method performance, where we explored reducible processes (with equal death rate or arbitrary death rates) and irreducible processes. We also applied our method to a published time-calibrated phylogenetic tree of squamata (reptiles) from Pyron et al. (2013).
